# Runo - Free HTML Blog Template

## Installation

1. Extract the release archive to a new directory, rename it to your project name and browse the directory.
2. Install all dependencies using `npm` *clean install* command. 

```sh 
$ npm ci
```

> More on the clean install npm command can be read here [`npm ci`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ci.html)

> You can still use `npm install` in cases the `npm ci` raises system error due to specific platform incompatibilities.
